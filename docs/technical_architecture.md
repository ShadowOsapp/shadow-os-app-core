# Technical Architecture

The ShadowOS protocol architecture consists of three modular layers:

**1. ZK Transaction Core**

Handles the generation, verification, and batching of **zero-knowledge x402 proofs**.\
This core ensures stealth transaction integrity, preventing double-spends while maintaining invisibility.

**2. AI Identity Layer**

Manages pseudonymous identity creation, reputation scoring, and AI-driven proof-of-personhood.\
Uses encrypted behavioral analysis and federated learning to preserve user privacy.

**3. Bridge Interface Layer**

A developer-facing layer providing **SDKs and APIs** for wallets, dApps, and merchants to integrate stealth payments and pseudonymous identity features.\
This ensures easy adoption while maintaining security and full decentralization.

Each transaction within ShadowOS follows a **privacy-preserving lifecycle**:

1. User initiates a payment request.
2. Data is encrypted and masked via x402 algorithms.
3. The network validates through zero-knowledge consensus.
4. The AI pseudonym updates both participants’ reputation shadows.

The outcome is an invisible transaction — verified, compliant, and secure.
