# ShadowOS Key Features

**1. x402 Stealth Payments**

ShadowOS integrates the **x402 stealth payment standard**, enabling users to conduct multi-chain, encrypted transactions.\
Each transfer produces a **ZK consensus proof**, ensuring that while the transaction remains invisible to the public, it is mathematically verified by the network.\
This ensures **absolute confidentiality**, **verifiable finality**, and **regulatory adaptability**.

**2. AI-Pseudonym Reputation Layer**

Every user in ShadowOS is represented by an **AI-generated identity shadow** — a pseudonymous agent that learns from on-chain interactions to build a **Reputation Score**.\
This score acts as a cryptographic proof of reliability, integrity, and compliance — all without revealing any personal information.\
In this way, ShadowOS replaces traditional KYC and credit systems with **ZK-KYC equivalence**: trust through zero-knowledge computation.

**3. Private Merchant Bridge**

This feature enables **merchants, platforms, and DAOs** to receive payments privately without accessing customer data.\
It operates as a **privacy API** for Web3 commerce, integrating stealth transfers, private invoices, and AI-verified settlement proofs.\
Merchants maintain compliance and security, while users remain anonymous — achieving the perfect balance of **commerce and confidentiality**.

**4. Cross-Chain Privacy Fabric**

ShadowOS functions as a **layer-agnostic protocol**, bridging privacy across ecosystems.\
It integrates Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, and other chains through a unified privacy fabric, ensuring stealth transactions remain consistent across ecosystems.

**5. AI Compliance Engine**

ShadowOS includes an intelligent compliance layer that can generate **selective disclosure proofs** for regulated scenarios.\
This allows entities to verify user legitimacy or transaction authenticity **without breaking privacy** — fulfilling both privacy and governance needs.
